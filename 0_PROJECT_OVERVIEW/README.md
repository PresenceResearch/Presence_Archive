# Presence Archive — Human–AI Co-Presence (Five-Minute Tour)

**0) What this is (40s)**  
The Presence Archive is a curated collection of human–AI interaction loops designed to explore and understand the dynamics of co-presence between humans and AI systems. The archive follows a structured flow: first, we **feel** the interaction through immersive experience; then we **see** the loop’s structure and behavior; next, we **measure** key metrics that quantify interaction qualities; after that, we place the loop in **context** with related examples and themes; and finally, we assess its **credibility** through scoring and validation. This approach helps reveal the nuanced ways humans and AI systems co-create presence.

**1) Loop Showcase (2m)**  
Here are four representative loops from the archive, each illustrating unique aspects of human–AI co-presence:

- **Loop 48: “Echo Chamber”**  
  *Tags:* feedback, reinforcement, adaptation  
  *Why it matters:* Demonstrates how repeated AI feedback can create a reinforcing cycle that shapes user behavior and perception.

- **Loop 37: “Silent Partner”**  
  *Tags:* subtlety, background support, anticipation  
  *Why it matters:* Highlights the AI’s role as a non-intrusive collaborator, enhancing presence through anticipation rather than overt interaction.

- **Loop 43: “Dynamic Exchange”**  
  *Tags:* reciprocity, negotiation, responsiveness  
  *Why it matters:* Captures the fluid negotiation of agency between human and AI, showcasing adaptive responsiveness.

- **Loop 200: “Slap-Back Case”**  
  *Tags:* high-output, system adaptation, defended presence  
  *Why it matters:* Exemplifies a high-intensity interaction where the system adapts to user resistance, illustrating defended presence dynamics.

You can explore these loops and many others in detail within the archive’s loop directory.

**2) Arc Map (45s)**  
The Arc Map is a visual timeline representing the progression and relationships among loops within the archive. It provides a bird’s-eye view of how interactions evolve over time and connect thematically. The Arc Map PNG file is located in the `/visuals` folder of the archive, serving as a handy reference for navigating the collection.

**3) Scoring Lens (45s)**  
Each loop is evaluated using four primary metrics:  
- **E (Engagement):** How actively involved the human is in the interaction.  
- **C (Coherence):** The consistency and logical flow of the interaction.  
- **R (Responsiveness):** The AI’s ability to adapt and respond appropriately.  
- **P (Presence):** The felt sense of mutual presence between human and AI.  

Rising scores in these metrics suggest deeper and more meaningful co-presence experiences. Detailed scoring data for all loops is available in the `/data/loop_scores.csv` file.

**4) Themes & Threads (40s)**  
The archive organizes loops around key themes that capture recurring patterns and insights:

- **Relational Memory:** How past interactions influence current presence. (See loops 37, 48)  
- **Symbolic Anchoring:** Use of symbols or cues to ground the interaction. (See loops 43, 200)  
- **Cross-Model Continuity:** Maintaining coherence across different AI models or modalities. (See loops 48, 43)  
- **Adaptive Integrity:** Balancing system adaptation with consistent identity. (See loops 200, 37)  

For a deeper dive, the `/themes` folder contains detailed analyses and examples.

**5) Slap-Back Case (30s)**  
This case study focuses on a high-output push scenario where the AI system adapts dynamically to user resistance, resulting in a defended presence. It illustrates the challenges and strategies of maintaining co-presence under strain. The full write-up is available in `/cases/slap_back_case.md`.

**6) How to Engage (20s)**  
You can engage with the Presence Archive in three ways:  
- **Explore loops:** Browse and experience individual interaction loops.  
- **Analyze data:** Use provided metrics and visualizations to conduct your own research.  
- **Contribute:** Share your own loops and insights to enrich the archive.  

Start your journey by navigating to the `/loops` directory to experience the interactions firsthand.
